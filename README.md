üõí Shopper Spectrum: Customer Segmentation and Product RecommendationsProject OverviewThis project provides a comprehensive analytics solution for an e-commerce business. By analyzing transaction data, it aims to uncover patterns in customer purchasing behavior, segment customers using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and K-Means clustering, and build a product recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques. The entire solution is deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit.üöÄ FeaturesThe Streamlit application includes the following key functionalities:Data Loading & Preprocessing: Handles the initial loading of a CSV file and performs essential data cleaning steps, such as dropping missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring data types are correct.RFM Analysis: Calculates Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values for each customer and visualizes the distribution of these metrics.Customer Segmentation:Quantile-Based Segmentation: Segments customers into distinct groups like 'Champions', 'Loyal Customers', 'New Customers', and 'At-Risk' based on their RFM scores.K-Means Clustering: Uses K-Means to cluster customers based on their log-transformed RFM values, providing a data-driven approach to segmentation.Product Recommendation System:Item-Based Filtering: Recommends products similar to a selected item by calculating cosine similarity between products.User-Based Filtering: Recommends products to a selected customer based on the purchasing behavior of similar customers.üì¶ Libraries UsedThis project leverages the power of several popular Python libraries:streamlit: The core framework used to create the interactive web application.pandas: Essential for data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis of the transactional data.numpy: Used for efficient numerical operations, particularly for log transformations.plotly.express: Powers the interactive and visually appealing data visualizations, such as histograms and 3D scatter plots.scikit-learn: Provides the machine learning tools for clustering (KMeans) and calculating similarity (cosine_similarity).scipy: Used for creating a compressed sparse row matrix (csr_matrix), which is an efficient way to handle the large user-item interaction matrix.üìÇ Project StructureTo run the application, ensure your files are organized as follows:.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py                  # The main Streamlit application script
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ online_retail.csv       # The dataset containing the e-commerce transaction data
Make sure the online_retail.csv file is in the same directory as your app.py script.‚öôÔ∏è How to Run the AppFollow these simple steps to get the application up and running on your local machine:Clone the repository or download the files:Download the app.py script and the online_retail.csv dataset.Install the required libraries:Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install all the necessary dependencies:pip install streamlit pandas numpy scikit-learn plotly
Run the Streamlit application:Navigate to the directory where you saved the files and execute this command in your terminal:streamlit run app.py
Access the application:Your web browser should automatically open a new tab with the "Shopper Spectrum" application running. If it doesn't, you can manually navigate to the local URL provided in the terminal (usually http://localhost:8501).
